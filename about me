Chris Fullerton about me
	I am a married thirty nine year old who has two step kids and a kid of my own. I have a degree already in wildlife and recently lost a job due to a buyout. 
I do get to go back to school paid for but I also have to work full time to sustain life. I work hard and try to do the right thing but the system has other ideas. 
I also love wildlife photography when I can get a chance to get out, if I can't get out I usually relax with some video games.
